Welcome to LoyalityCards ("we," "our," or "app"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This privacy policy explains how we handle your data when you use our app.

## Overview

LoyalityCards is an application that:

- Does not collect personal information beyond what is necessary for app functionality

## Information We Collect

### Camera Access

We request access to your device's camera solely for the purpose of scanning barcodes and EAN codes of loyalty cards. The camera is only accessed when you actively use the scanning feature.

### Loyalty Card Information

We store the following information locally on your device:
- Barcode/EAN codes of your loyalty cards

## How We Use Your Information

All information collected is used exclusively to:

All data is stored exclusively on your device in a local database. We do not:
- Upload your data to any servers

### Unencrypted Storage

Please be aware that the data is stored in an unencrypted format on your device. We recommend using your device's built-in security features (PIN, pattern, fingerprint, or face recognition) to protect access to your device.

## Third-Party Access

We do not share your data with any third parties. No advertising networks, analytics providers, or other external services are used within the app that would have access to your data.

## Your Rights

In accordance with privacy regulations such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), you have the following rights:

- **Right to Deletion**: You can delete individual cards or uninstall the app to remove all stored data.
- **Right to Data Portability**: While we don't currently offer data export features, all data is stored locally and is not trapped in our systems.

## Children's Privacy

Our app does not specifically target children under the age of 13 (U.S.) or 16 (EU). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
